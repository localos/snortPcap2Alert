# snortPcap2Alert
Simple script for creating an alert file per pcap with snort. There might be better solution, but for the moment this script does all what is needed ^^

## Use Case
Currently the script is used to process a directory of pcap files and generating one output directory for each pcap file if there are any alerts for this file.

With some minor adjustements, this script might also be used to "monitor" a directory where pcaps are generated in and move them away after being processed.
